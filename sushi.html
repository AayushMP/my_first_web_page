        <p id="par">Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice,
          though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is
          very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail,
          salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are
          vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi,
          and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular
          garnishes for the dish.</p>
